## Automated Tests

We use a combination of testing frameworks to ensure functionality accross platforms and browsers

### Unit & Integration Tests

We use the jest testing framework. Run these tests with `npm test`

### E2E Tests

We use selenium for browser autmation in conjunction with the pytest framework. To run these tests, `cd` into the `pytest` directory. If you've never run the tests you'll need to configure the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this initial setup you can run the whole test suite with the command `pytest`

For more detailed information on supported platforms see [E2E Testing](./pytest/README.md)
